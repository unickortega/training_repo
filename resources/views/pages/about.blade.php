                <h2><strong> Mission</strong></h2>
                <h4>LSAPP is software designed for everyone, emphasizing accessibility, performance, security, and ease of use. We believe great software should work with minimum set up, so you can focus on sharing your story, product, or services freely. The basic LSAPP software is simple and predictable so you can easily get started. It also offers powerful features for growth and success.
                
                We believe in democratizing publishing and the freedoms that come with open source. Supporting this idea is a large community of people collaborating on and contributing to this project. The LSAPP community is welcoming and inclusive. Our contributorsâ€™ passion drives the success of LSAPP which, in turn, helps you reach your goals. </h4>
